## Development

BootstrapExtended is made with sass and a theme file, which means you can always change something and just recompile the scss file. Support for bootstrap themes from Bootswatch will be available in release 2.0.

## Missing documentation

If there appears to be new components and they have no documentation, you can always find every one of them in "showcase/testing.html".
